AIM:
To perform dimensionality reduction using PCA on the Iris dataset and analyze explained variance.

ALGORITHM:
1. Standardize the data
2. Fit PCA with desired components
3. Examine explained variance ratio
4. Visualize reduced data

PROGRAM 10 (exact code):
To implement Dimensionality Reduction using PCA in a python program.

Algorithm:

Step 1: Import Libraries
Import necessary libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and
sklearn.decomposition.PCA.

Step 2: Load the Dataset (iris dataset)
Load your dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

Step 3: Standardize the Data
Standardize the features of the dataset using StandardScaler from
sklearn.preprocessing.

Step 4: Apply PCA
● Create an instance of PCA with the desired number of components.
● Fit PCA to the standardized data.
● Transform the data to its principal components using
transform. 

Step 5: Explained Variance Ratio
● Calculate the explained variance ratio for each principal component.
● Plot a scree plot to visualize the explained variance
ratio. 

Step 6: Choose the Number of Components
Based on the scree plot, choose the number of principal components that explain a significant
amount of variance.

Step 7: Apply PCA with Chosen Components
Apply PCA again with the chosen number of components.

Step 8: Visualize the Reduced Data
● Transform the original data to the reduced dimension using the fitted PCA.
● Visualize the reduced data using a scatter plot.

Step 9: Interpretation
Interpret the results, considering the trade-offs between dimensionality reduction and information
loss

OUTPUT:
Explained variance: PC1 ≈ 72%, PC2 ≈ 23%, PC3 ≈ 5%
